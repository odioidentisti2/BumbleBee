#     # I'd like this intensity to be "absolute" (referred to the whole training set).
#     # But attention weights are very relative to each molecule (and proportionate to the number of bonds, after softmax).
#     # So I need to find a "max intensity" threshold from the training set, to normalize it,
#     # I can divide by the mean attention weight for each molecule.
#     # In conclusion: given the distribution of attention max/mean ratio in the training set, I can set a threshold
#     # (e.g. mean + std) to be the "max intensity" (1.0) in the depiction, so that only "outlier" weights
#     # are fully highlighted. In other words, let's say that the maximum max/mean ratio in any molecule
#     # in the training set was 30 (30 times more attention than the average), mean + std will be lower than that,
#     # let's say 7, so in the depiction an attention weight 7 times higher than the average
#     # will be highlighted with intensity 1.0.
